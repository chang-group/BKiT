<h2>Introduction</h2>
Binding Kinetic Toolkit (BKiT) is an open-source, comprehensive post-molecular dynamics (MD) analysis toolkit providing a wide array of analysis functions and visualizations for researchers with varied levels of expertise in molecular mechanics. BKiT robustly guides the construction of ligand binding/unbinding free energy (FE) landscape, also termed potential of mean force (PMF), which reveals both binding affinity and kinetics for drug design. With the FE landscape using milestoning theory implemented in BKiT, previous studies demonstrated that our designed compound achieved better drug binding residence time in experiments. Its analytical functions include, but not limited to, reducing high-dimensional ligandâ€“protein motions to a 2D or 3D space using principal component analysis (PCA) for conformation analysis and better description of molecular motions using Cartesian or internal bond-angle-torsion (BAT) coordinates.
